# Daily StrataScratch Practice

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Strata-Scratch)

[StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) is an excellent practice platform to prepare for data science jobs. I found its interface very user-friendly, and its questions are well curated, assorted, and challenging - accompanied by my favourite book, "Ace The Data Science Interview" by Singh and Huo.

SS divides its question repository into two main categories, Coding and Non-coding Questions, which I followed to organize my folders. Multiple subfolders contain my codes and thought processes when I answered these questions.
