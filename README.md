# StrataScratch Practice

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Strata-Scratch)

[StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) is an excellent practice platform to prepare for data science jobs. I found its UI very user-friendly and clean, and its questions are well curated, assorted, and challenging - accompanied by my favourite book, "Ace The Data Science Interview" by Singh and Huo.

SS divides its question repository into two main categories, Coding and Non-coding Questions, which I followed to organize my folders. Multiple subfolders contain my codes and thought processes when I answered these questions.

**Notes:**

- In case that you doubt if SS is worth it, please check out some Reddit threads: [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/166wmef/some_thoughts_about_leetcode_sql_and/), [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/149acla/thought_i_was_good_in_sql_until_i_tried/), [[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16550a0/is_stratascratch_any_good_for_de_prep_at_lifetime/).
- I highly recommend their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stratascratch) for their walkthrough videos solving some interview questions. This helps us to learn how to break down the question and answer it in a logical way.
- Questions on SS can be answered by different programming languages (Python, SQL, R, PySpark, etc.). For example, check out this question [10353](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10353-workers-with-the-highest-salaries?code_type=2).
- SS suggests a good framework that we can use for any coding question:
  1. Exploring the Dataset.
  1. Writing out the Approach.
  1. Coding the Solution.
