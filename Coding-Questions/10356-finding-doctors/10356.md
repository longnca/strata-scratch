- Google

## Question

Find doctors with the last name of 'Johnson' in the employee list. The output should contain both their first and last names.

- DataFrame: employee_list.
- employee_list

## My Solution

I used SS' framework to break down the problem and answer it.

### Exploring the Dataset

The pandas DataFrame called "employee_list" contains 6 columns. We will only ocus on 3 columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `profession` because they are related to what the question asks.

Notice that the question tries to trick us when having 'Johnson' also appear in `first_name` column.

### Writing out the Approach

In Python code:
